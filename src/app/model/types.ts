// Each frame is a function of the Entities and Actions that are defined in the state.
//
// The first frame is decided by the explicit starting position of each entity.
//
// The next frame is decided by going through each action and filtering out those that don't have a
// start and end time that encompasses that frame. For the remaining actions, the position will be
// interpolated by looking at the end position of the action and how long the action is. For
// example, if the action is to bump the ball 10 feet to the left in 5 frames, then the ball will
// move 2 feet to the left.
//
// Some actions will behave differently for different entities. For example, bumping a ball will
// move the ball, but the player will stay still and move only their arms.
//
// An action will always have a well-defined start and end time. However, it is tricky to define
// where that action starts and ends.
//

//
// Every action has a source (which must be of type player), a type (spike, set, jump, shuffle,
// etc...), and a target (a position or entity).
